1.  Smart Street Lights using Ultrasonic Sensors  This is an implementation of a working model which will be able to detect motion and switch on the LEDS  accordingly .The  technology has emerged as an innovative smart city  application with great potential to reduce energy cost and enhance public safety. The system  demonstrates the benefits of two smart city applications for public safety enhancement, while revealing multiple cyber-security challenges.  


2. Voice Controlled Lights using NodeMCU  Google assistant is AI (Artificial Intelligence) based voice command service. Using voice, we can interact with google assistant and it can search on the internet, schedule events, set alarms, control appliances, etc.   This service is available on smartphones and Google Home devices.  We can control smart home devices including lights, switches, fans and thermostats using our Google Assistant.   We will build an application which can control home appliances. Here, we will control a 60W bulb using Google Assistant service just by our voice.   This application includes Google assistant along with Adafruit server and IFTTT service.
